# OnlyFans AI Girl – Custom Fine-Tuned Open Source Model

**Complete training plan & documentation** (February 2026)  
Build your own realistic, flirty, money-making OnlyFans AI chatter using **fully open-source tools**.

## Project Goal
Create a custom 8B model that:
- Sounds like a real playful, horny OnlyFans girl
- Holds long natural sexting conversations
- Builds emotional connection + upsells PPV/customs
- Runs locally or cheap cloud

## Base Model Recommendations (2026 Best Picks)

**#1 Recommended (Start Here)**  
`cognitivecomputations/dolphin-3.1-llama-3.1-8b`  
→ Extremely uncensored, best at dirty talk & roleplay right now.

**Strong #2**  
`NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B`  
→ Excellent personality, long coherent chats, great for OnlyFans vibe.

**Other great options**  
- Any “abliterated” or DarkIdol Llama-3.1-8B variant  
We stick to **8B** models — they train fast (2-6 hrs), run on one 4090, and are perfect for beginners.

## Dataset
**Repo**: https://github.com/labsensacional/sexting-dataset  
Real erotic conversations scraped from Kik, Wattpad, etc. Perfect tone & style for OnlyFans.

**Structure**  
- `clean/` → clean .txt conversation files  
- `raw/` → original files  
- `sexting_dataset.txt` → everything combined

**MIT license** → safe to use commercially.

### 🚨 MANDATORY LEGAL WARNING
**You MUST clean this dataset yourself.**  
Some scraped chats may contain underage content.  

**Do this before ANY training**:
1. Open every .txt file in `clean/` and `raw/`
2. Delete anything mentioning age < 18, “teen”, “schoolgirl”, “18yo” (even if it says 18+ — be strict)
3. Only keep clearly adult conversations

Training on or keeping any CSAM (even text) is a serious crime in basically every country.  
**I am not joking** — clean it or don’t use the dataset.

## Training Method
**Technique**: QLoRA (4-bit) with **Unsloth**  
→ 2× faster training, 60-70% less VRAM than normal methods  
→ Perfect for 4090 or cheap cloud rental

**Alternative easy GUI**: LLaMA-Factory (Web UI)

## Hardware
- **Local best**: RTX 4090  
- **Good**: RTX 3090 / 4080  
- **No GPU?** Rent on RunPod / Vast.ai / Massed Compute (~$0.60–$1.20 per hour)
